Logic: Get input 1 and store it to cell 0. Move to cell 1. Get input 2 and store it to cell 1.
Move back to cell 0.
Loop: Decrement 1. Move to cell 1. Increment 1. Move to cell 0. End loop when cell 0 is equal to 0.
Move to cell 1. Decrement by 48, then print. Decrementing by 48 is necessary as Brainfuck takes the ASCII values
of the two inputs, adds their ASCII values together, and prints the ASCII character
